## Credits

The regex used has been blindly copied from GeeksforGeeks' regex example (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/python-regex/)  
So, major credit goes to them.  
This is just a CLI app for the same.

## Dependency

Only one that Python3 is installed and all the standard Libraries are available.  
If not please go ahead and install.  
A Note to Windows users: Make sure Python is added to path

## Usage

### Installation

#### Linux users, run this command

(What you are doing: Downloading the files and giving the main file executable status.)

`$ git clone https://github.com/t3chn0tr0n/url_sniffer.git && cd url_sniffer && chmod +x setup.py && ./setup.py`

From next time just use `sniffurl` followed by the "path/to/file" you want to sniff for urls, like:  
`$ sniffurl path/to/file`

You can either save the output in a file, or the result will be displayed anyway!

#### Windows users

Sorry, but no installation available for you guys!  
Download the zip file.  
Now extract it where you want to use/keep!
(You can delete other files, except `sniff_in_windows.py`.)
If you have Python3 installed and added to path, open cmd.exe, and type:  
`> cd path/where/you/extracted/ && python sniff_in_windows.py path/to/file`

## Few known bugs and solutions

1. Any emoticon symbols may cause error! remove the manually if so!
2. Since it was developed over Windows and Linux platform, problems with encoding may arise.  
   Use a program called 'dos2unix' to fix it! Use:  
   `$ dos2unix ~/.url_sniffer/url_sniffer/sniff.py`

## Last Things last

This piece of software is still in development!  
Expect bugs!  
Please comment if any bug is found!
